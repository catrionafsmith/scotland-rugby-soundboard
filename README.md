Scotland v Australia Rugby Soundboard is a soundboard based on Wes Bos' JavaScript30 Day 1 project. It was made to celebrate the Scotland v Australia rugby match on 29th October 2022. By clicking on the buttons on your keyboard, you can hear the atmosphere of the match!

**What I have learned:**
I learned how to use EventListeners to dynamically play sounds, and also how to set the currentTime of the audio to 0 so that sounds could be repeatedly played without having to wait ustil the end of the sound. I also learned that all keys have a keyCode which is assciated with them (e.g. the keyCode for 'g' is 71).

**What issues have I faced and how I resolved them:**
I would have struggled to figure out the querySelector for the keys and audio so that i coould get these to react to the key presses. This information was provided by Wes Bos, so in the future I could try to complete a simpler version of this project myself from scratch in order to solidify my understanding on this point.
