Scotland Rugby Soundboard is a soundboard based on Wes Bos' JavaScript30 Day 1 project. It was made to celebrate the atmosphere at Scotland rugby games, and is a mobile-responsive variation of my Scotland v Australia soundboard made on 29th October 2022. By pressing the buttons on the screen, you can hear the atmosphere of Scotland rubgy games!

**Built with:**
The index-START.html file shows the initial HTML, CSS and JS information that was provided by Wes.
The HTML and CSS was updated slightly, with the keys and keydown event listeners in the original project changed to buttons and button clicks.

**What I have learned:**
In this adaptation, I learned how to replace keys and keydown event listeners with buttons and button clicks. I also learned how to use the Chrome dev tools to see how my project would look on mobile devices.

**What issues have I faced and how I resolved them:**
I struggled to figure out the querySelector for the buttons and audio so that i coould get these to react to the clicks. I think that I could use a buttons.forEach function to add the click event listener to all of the buttons, but I wanted to get this project finished quickly, so I just repeated the code for each audio source instead. If I have time in the future I may revisit this project and improve the logic and brevity of the code.
